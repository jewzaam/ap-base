+Copy and organize master calibration frames from source to organized library based on FITS/XISF header metadata.
+
+## Overview
+
+This tool copies master calibration frames (bias, dark, flat) from a source directory to an organized library structure based on metadata extracted from FITS/XISF headers.
+
+## Installation
+
+### From Source (Development)

+### From Git Repository
+
+```bash
+pip install git+https://github.com/jewzaam/ap-move-calibration.git
+```
+
+## Usage
+
+```bash
+ap-move-calibration <source_dir> <dest_dir> [--debug] [--dryrun]
+```
+
+Options:
+- `source_dir`: Source directory containing master calibration frames
+- `dest_dir`: Destination directory for organized library
+- `--debug`: Enable debug output
+- `--dryrun`: Perform dry run without actually copying files
+
